/**
 * Development seed data.
 *
 * Not production data and not a migration: this exists so that the
 * catalogue can be developed, reviewed and screenshotted against
 * realistic content, and so that visibility rules can be *demonstrated*
 * rather than asserted. The set below deliberately includes courses that
 * must NOT appear in the public catalogue — a draft, an archived course,
 * and a published-but-PRIVATE one — because a visibility filter that is
 * only ever tested against data it accepts has not been tested at all.
 *
 * Idempotent: every write is an upsert keyed on a natural unique field, so
 * running it twice changes nothing. Never destructive — it does not
 * truncate, because a seed script that deletes rows is one careless
 * environment variable away from doing so in production (§41).
